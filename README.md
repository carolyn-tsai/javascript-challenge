JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

For this project:

The code written in this repository will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided by "ALIENS-R-REAL." Users who visit the site will be able to filter the table data for specific values.

## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

- This folder contains a basic HTML web page
- Code will append a table to the web page and add new rows of data for each UFO sighting
  - UFO dataset provided is in the form of an array of JavaScript objects
  - There is a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comments
- The web page has a date form in the HTML document and uses JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

This folder contains all of the above in the Level 1 folder along with the following:
- Code will use multiple input tags and select dropdowns
- The user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  - date/time
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape
